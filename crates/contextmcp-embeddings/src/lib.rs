//! ContextMCP Embeddings - Placeholder
//!
//! This crate is intentionally minimal. ContextMCP uses keyword-based
//! search via Tantivy rather than external ML models for embeddings.
//! This keeps the server fully self-contained with no external dependencies.

// No embedding functionality - search is handled by Tantivy full-text search
